## Restoration of Ancestral Plasticity Contributes to Plastic Heterosis in Fatty liver of Hybrid Ducks
### Overview  
This repository contains scripts and pipelines used in the analysis of transcriptomic plasticity and heterosis in hybrid ducks.  

### Workflow  
1. **Quantify gene expression** in parental species, hybrid ducks, and geese under two feeding conditions.  
2. **Infer ancestral gene expression plasticity** from Muscovy and Peking ducks.  
3. **Identify genes with adaptive and nonadaptive plasticity** in gene expression.  
4. **Estimate the degree of heterosis** in fatty liver development of hybrid ducks.  
5. **Classify modes of gene expression inheritance** in hybrid ducks.
